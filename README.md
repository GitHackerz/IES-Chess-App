### Updated Documentation for Dynamic Chess Timer and Match List

---

#### **ChessTimerScreen**

**Purpose**:  
The `ChessTimerScreen` is designed to manage dynamic chess timers for two players. It allows for real-time countdowns, alternating turns between Player 1 and Player 2, with automatic timer switching when a player finishes their turn.

**Key Updates**:
- **Dynamic Timer Handling**: The timers for both players are now dynamic, with the ability to adjust the starting time (e.g., can easily switch from 5 minutes to any other duration).
- **Turn Management**: Instead of hard-coding the players, it can dynamically switch between two players based on the game flow.

**State Management**:
- The `player1Time` and `player2Time` variables are dynamically updated based on game progress.
- Timers are initiated and stopped using `Timer.periodic` with safe null checks to prevent errors.
- Player names and times are updated dynamically when the player switches turns.

**Dynamic Timer Behavior**:
```dart
// Dynamically start the timer for the current player
void startTimer(int playerIndex) {
  Timer? currentPlayerTimer;
  int *currentPlayerTime;
  
  if (playerIndex == 1) {
    currentPlayerTime = player1Time;
    currentPlayerTimer = _player1Timer;
  } else {
    currentPlayerTime = player2Time;
    currentPlayerTimer = _player2Timer;
  }

  currentPlayerTimer = Timer.periodic(const Duration(seconds: 1), (timer) {
    setState(() {
      if (currentPlayerTime > 0) {
        currentPlayerTime--;
      } else {
        currentPlayerTimer?.cancel();
      }
    });
  });
}
```

#### **ChessMatchListScreen**

**Purpose**:  
The `ChessMatchListScreen` dynamically fetches and displays a list of past matches. The data shown (e.g., player names, scores, dates) can be fetched from a database or API to keep the list up-to-date and reflect real-time match history.

**Key Updates**:
- **Dynamic Match List**: The list of chess matches is now dynamic, which means it can easily integrate with a backend or local data source to fetch match data.
- **Navigation to Match Details**: Users can navigate to a detailed match screen, which will be populated with data from the list.

**Dynamic Data Handling**:
```dart
class ChessMatchListScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  final List<ChessMatch> chessMatches;  // Dynamic list of matches

  const ChessMatchListScreen({Key? key, required this.chessMatches}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: const Text('Chess Matches', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold)), backgroundColor: Colors.brown),
      body: ListView.builder(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        itemCount: chessMatches.length,
        itemBuilder: (context, index) {
          return ChessMatchTile(match: chessMatches[index]);
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}

class ChessMatchTile extends StatelessWidget {
  final ChessMatch match;

  const ChessMatchTile({Key? key, required this.match}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Card(
      margin: const EdgeInsets.symmetric(vertical: 10.0),
      shape: RoundedRectangleBorder(borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(10.0)),
      elevation: 5,
      child: Padding(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
        child: Row(
          children: [
            const Icon(Icons.games, size: 40, color: Color(0xFF2A4ECA)),
            const SizedBox(width: 12.0),
            Expanded(
              child: Column(
                crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
                children: [
                  Text('${match.playerName} vs ${match.aiName}', style: const TextStyle(fontSize: 18.0, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold)),
                  const SizedBox(height: 5.0),
                  Text('Score: ${match.score}', style: const TextStyle(fontSize: 16.0, color: Color(0xFF61677D))),
                  const SizedBox(height: 5.0),
                  Text('Date: ${match.matchDate}', style: const TextStyle(fontSize: 14.0, color: Color(0xFF61677D))),
                  const SizedBox(height: 5.0),
                  Text('Time: ${match.matchTime}', style: const TextStyle(fontSize: 14.0, color: Color(0xFF61677D))),
                ],
              ),
            ),
            IconButton(icon: const Icon(Icons.arrow_forward_ios), onPressed: () {
              // Navigate to match details screen with the selected match
            }),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

**Match Model Class**:
To handle dynamic data, we introduced a `ChessMatch` model:
```dart
class ChessMatch {
  final String playerName;
  final String aiName;
  final String score;
  final String matchDate;
  final String matchTime;

  ChessMatch({
    required this.playerName,
    required this.aiName,
    required this.score,
    required this.matchDate,
    required this.matchTime,
  });
}
```

**Dynamic Match Data**:
Instead of hardcoding matches, the match data can now be populated dynamically:
```dart
List<ChessMatch> chessMatches = [
  ChessMatch(playerName: 'Player 1', aiName: 'AI Robot', score: '1 - 0', matchDate: '2024-11-20', matchTime: '12:00 PM'),
  ChessMatch(playerName: 'Player 2', aiName: 'AI Robot', score: '0 - 1', matchDate: '2024-11-19', matchTime: '3:00 PM'),
  // More matches
];
```

### **Key Benefits of the Dynamic Approach**:
1. **Scalability**: Easily integrates with a backend or API to fetch real-time data.
2. **Flexibility**: Both the chess timer and match list are adaptable to different settings, such as game length or player configurations.
3. **Real-Time Updates**: Match results and timers update dynamically, ensuring that the app reflects the current state of the game and match history.

### **Conclusion**:
With these updates, the app now supports dynamic data for both the chess timers and match list, providing a flexible and scalable foundation for future features, such as persistent game history, user profiles, and more.
